Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

This project is to provide a report for an investor bank that is considering launching a new bitcoin investment portfolio. We will be using Crypto Compare's data to run unsupervised machine learning algorithms in order to complete this project.
The future customer wants to know which cryptocurrencies are available for purchase and how they may be classified to develop a categorization system for this new investment.

## Results

We have cleaned up the data to include only active trading cryptocurrencies with a specified algorithm and a comprehensive set of data. As a result, we now have 532 distinct cryptocurrencies. Then, constructed a three-dimensional graph to demonstrate how the various cryptocurrencies are organised. Each point has a name as well as the algorithm that was used to produce it.

A two-dimensional graph is presented to demonstrate the link between total coin supply and total coins mined.

## Summary

There are four distinct groups seen in the three-dimensional graph. Most currencies fall into one of two categories, which are clumped together quite closely. The first group has a few distinct currencies that are separated from the others, whereas the second group just has one currency. This demonstrates that many currencies behave similarly, but a few stand out as outliers. These outliers might be overachievers or underachievers. Looking at the total coin supply versus total coins mined graph is one way we can make a connection. The majority of the data points for the two main categories are spread between 0% and 40% of the biggest currency by volume. The group with a few currencies is extremely near to 0% of the largest currency, but the group with only one currency is at 100% since it is the largest. We would want to do further research on these cryptocurrencies by looking at their history price in order to better understand their performance. This would allow investors to determine how hazardous or reliable their investment is dependent on the many cryptocurrencies they invest in.
